Individual Brainstorm
‚ùì Question #1:  Describe your website subject in detail:

What do you already know about your social impact topic? (50+ words)
The social impact project I would like to do would be for an animal shelter for abused and neglected dogs and cats.  I‚Äôve worked several years as a volunteer, foster, and rescue owner for such organizations as well as was a vet tech when I was younger.  I know a lot about different types of animals and how to help animals who have had difficult pasts. I would also like to link to local low-cost spay and neuter programs to help low-income families.  I would like our organization to focus more on matching pets to people rather than people focusing on the breed- this would be through a questionnaire that would show them different animals we had for adoption that would fit their personality, fitness level, and lifestyle.


What do you still need to find out about your social impact topic in order to create a meaningful website? (20+ words)
I believe I would need to find ways to market my website to people in order to encourage them to adopt or to let them know about the animals that we have for adoption.  I also would need to figure out a good page layout that would be pleasing to visitors so they felt it was easy to navigate and use.


Who are the stakeholders involved with/affected by your social impact topic? ie children, people living in cities, politicians, CEOs, female-identifying persons (20+ words)
The stakeholders would be the community that I am servicing and animals in areas that have few rescue and volunteer options available for them.  Many shelters are overcrowded at the moment and very few people step forward to adopt or foster.  I would like to create a location that is safe for adoptable pets until they are adopted.


‚ùì Question #2: Describe your proposed website in detail:

What is the purpose of your website? (30+ words)
The purpose would be to help find homes for animals that need them.  I think a good idea for a pet website would be to do a questionnaire that would match different people with the type of pet they may be interested in, for example, the user could take a quiz that would help determine if they were wanting a pet that was high energy or low and that quiz would pull up results for pets that match what they were looking for. So often people focus on breeds rather than the type of pet that would fit their lifestyle and situation that they currently have.


Who is your intended user? (30+ words)
My intended users would be people who are looking to adopt a pet for a companion.  I would cater to the community that I live in and surrounding rural areas that do not often have shelters or volunteers for their stray, neglected, or abused pets.


How will your users interact with your website? (30+ words)
I would like the user to have an option to take a quiz that would set them up with the pets we have that would best fit their lifestyle.  From there, I‚Äôd like it to show them those pets and a little information about each.  If the user  was interested in a pet, I would offer a meet-and-greet page.  If the match hit it off, we would have them fill out an adoption form, if they were approved, they would be able to adopt the pet.
